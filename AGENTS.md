# Repo Instructions for Codex

* Run `python3 -m py_compile mediacenter.py` after modifying the Python file to ensure there are no syntax errors.
* There are no automated tests. Manual execution can be done via `python3 mediacenter.py`, but this launches a GUI and may not work in headless mode.
* Follow PEP8 style for Python code.
